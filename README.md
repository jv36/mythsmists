## A story on love & loss, powered by Lanterna

Myths and Mists is based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, a story about a newlywed couple that turns into a proof of love, an encounter with the underworld and with loss. An unforgettable and touching story that we crafted into a Java interactive adventure, powered by Lanterna.

## Structure

Just like a musical or a play, the game will be divided into 3 different acts: each with its own particularities.

### Act 1: A Lovers' Story / Into the Underworld

The first act will be presented to the user in 2 segments:
> A Lovers' Story (Prologue)

> Into the Underworld

**A Lovers' Story**

The first segment of Act 1 is a text-based story. The window will show the beginning of the myth. ***The Prologue***. 

Keep in mind that, during the game, text-based sentences will be showed, just to keep context of the story and improve the overall storytelling experience.

*It's the boring part, we get that.*

**Into the Underworld**

Without getting into much detail or spoil, Orpheus will need to go into the Underworld. 

In this level, the base will be the 'hero' tutorial presented in class.

Our 'hero', Orpheus, is trying to reach the Underworld to talk to Hades. Orpheus must negotiate with the enigmatic ferryman, Charon, to cross the River Styx. The toll for his journey is precisely 10 dracmas.
This quest unfolds across two distinct maps, each demanding the collection of 5 dracmas. However, the path is fraught with perils, as Orpheus must navigate through souls and enemies. Beware, for the hero's energy is limited, and succumbing to the challenges along the way could jeopardize the mission.

You'll have the possibility to retry, if failed.

Upon successfully collecting the required 10 dracmas, the narrative transitions, the window fading to black, signaling the commencement of Act 2. The stage is set for the unfolding saga in the depths of the Underworld, where Orpheus's fate and the fate of his love hang in the balance.

*A true hero shall pass Act 1 at the first try.*

### Act 2: RUN!

The second act focus on the Underworld and its chaos.

Still following a simple approach, the user will now have to face all of the dangers of the Underworld and have a talk with Hades.

Your mission is to navigate this realm unscathed, contending with dangers like the formidable Cerberus heads and numerous adversaries. Your choices and dexterity are crucial in preserving Orpheus's energy for the impending meeting with Hades.

Upon reaching the ruler of the Underworld, a poetic text section unfolds, capturing the essence of the profound interaction between Orpheus and Hades. Amidst the verses, a solemn promise is made, shaping the narrative and paving the way for the resolution of Orpheus's quest.

An unsettling feeling clings to your chest as your mind echoes a haunting reminder:

*Don't look back on a promise.*

### Act 3: Turning Love into Death

After the said promise, Orpheus will walk out of the  Underworld.

You will be presented with a simple corridor and a sentence at the top of the screen, tempting you with a single choice: "Want to look back? Press [L]."

The corridor stretches ahead, dimly lit, and a palpable sense of tension hangs in the air. You feel the weight of the sentence, a silent reminder of the consequences that may follow your actions.

With each step, you wrestle with the decision to look back. The temptation grows, and you can't shake the feeling that something significant lies behind you. 

Your instincts and trust in the journey urge you forward, but the allure of the unknown, coupled with the haunting sentence, lingers. The choice is yours—press [L] to look back or continue your path, driven by trust and determination.

As you navigate this corridor of uncertainty, the echoes of your decision ripple through the narrative, shaping the destiny of both you and your lover. The sentence serves as a constant reminder of the delicate balance between curiosity and steadfastness, leaving the outcome in your hands. The corridor becomes a metaphorical battleground where trust and temptation collide, and the consequences of your choice unfold in the unfolding story of love and destiny.

> Good Ending

> Bad Ending

**Triumph of Love: Good Ending**

In the final moments of the game, your unwavering trust in your instincts and your deep love for Eurydice led you to the path of triumph. Despite the haunting whispers of the shivering sentence that echoed through your mind, you resisted the temptation to look back when you shouldn't have. Your determination and courage prevailed, proving that love can indeed conquer the fates. As a result, you have reached the elusive good ending. The narrative unfolds, congratulating you on your resilience and the strength of your connection with Eurydice. The tale concludes on a triumphant note, leaving you with a sense of accomplishment and the satisfaction of defying the odds.

**Heartbreak and Regret: Bad Ending**

Despite your best efforts, the weight of nerves and anxiety proved too much to bear. In a moment of weakness, you succumbed to the temptation and looked back. The consequences of this action are immediate and irreversible. The game comes to an abrupt end, signaling the arrival of the bad ending. The narrative conveys a sense of heartbreak and regret, emphasizing the significance of that critical choice. The shivering sentence, once a mere warning, now stands as a haunting reminder of what might have been. The story concludes on a somber note, leaving players to reflect on the impact of their decisions and the fragility of the line between success and failure.


In this narrative twist, the addition of a good ending provides players with a sense of agency and the possibility of a positive outcome, deviating from the original myth to create a more varied and engaging gaming experience.

*All good things must come to an end. The bad ones too.*
